Title=Resource Server Operator-Requesting Party: Give-Accurate-Access

Text=When the Resource Server responds in any fashion to a Client's access request, the Resource Server Operator gains an obligation to the Requesting Party to give accurate access to the protected resource according to whether the Requesting Party has permission to do so.

Comments=The Resource Server Operator, as a Subject that is otherwise potentially not obligated to the Authorization Server Operator, carries a great deal of responsibility here to make every effort to grant access where the Authorization Server has associated authorization data to guide access. Its interpretation of scopes and permissions, particularly in the case where the RPT presented by the Client uses the "bearer" RPT profile, is not entirely auditable by the requester or Authorization Server. Further, issues can arise from the skew between permission validity periods and actual access. Defining and using different RPT profiles can mitigate the risk of failure on the Resource Server Operator's part.

Issues=The relying party traditionally always has the right of refusal. The resource server may have additional authorization context available only to it that suggests it should not grant access, for example. Should this obligation be struck?
