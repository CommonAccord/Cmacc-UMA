Title=Resource Server Operator-Authorizing Party: Delegate-Protection

Text=When the Authorization Server issues a PAT to a Resource Server and as long as the PAT is valid, the Resource Server Operator gains an obligation to the Authorizing Party to delegate protection services to the Authorization Server Operator for the set of protectable resources for which it represents this capability to the Authorizing Party, and to respect the authorization data that the Authorization Server has associated with an RPT when the Resource Server subsequently allows or disallows access by the Client that presented that RPT.

Comments=Once the Authorization Server Operator becomes the Authorizing Party's authorization proxy, it begins relying on the Resource Server Operator in other, more specific ways. The Resource Server has the opportunity to inspect AM-issued permissions or take other actions that delegate protection responsibility to the Authorization Server at a later stage, but its responsibility for respecting them begins now. The specific protection services made available to the Resource Server by the Authorization Server differ depending on the RPT profile in use. This obligation can be removed through PAT revocation.
