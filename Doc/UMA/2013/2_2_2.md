Title=Requesting Party-Authorization Server Operator: Supply-Truthful-Claims

Text=When the Authorization Server issues an AAT to a Client and for as long as the AAT is valid, the Requesting Party using that Client gains an obligation to the Authorization Server Operator to supply or facilitate access to truthful claims required for access authorization at this AM, when it chooses to supply them, to the best of its knowledge at the time it supplies them.

Comments=At a later stage, the Requesting Party might be asked to provide claims to support authorization processes at this Authorization Server for accessing all resources protected by this Authorization Server, managed by any Authorizing Parties, at any Resource Servers. The Requesting Party's responsibility to act in good faith in interacting with this Authorization Server begins now because factual claims it supplies could be reused for more than one access-sharing relationship. This obligation can be removed through AAT revocation.
