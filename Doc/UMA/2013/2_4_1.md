Title=Authorization Server Operator-Authorizing Party: Follow-Policies-Accurately-and-Timely

Text=When the Authorization Server issues a PAT to the Resource Server and as long as the PAT is valid, the Authorization Server Operator gains an obligation to the Authorizing Party to adhere to the Authorizing Party's policies accurately and timely in granting permissions.

Comments=At a later stage, the Authorization Server will require the Resource Server to present the PAT whenever it uses the Authorization Serverâ€™s protection API on behalf of this Authorizing Party. The Authorization Server Operator may have contracted with the Authorizing Party for service-level agreements to respond specifically to timeliness needs and so on. This obligation can be removed through PAT revocation.
