Title=Resource Server Operator-Authorization Server Operator: Register-Accurately-and-Timely

Text=When the Authorization Server issues a PAT to the Resource Server and as long as the PAT is valid, the Resource Server Operator gains an obligation to the Authorization Server Operator to register resource set descriptions accurately and timely according to the Authorizing Partyâ€™s expressed instructions for protection.

Comments=At a later stage, the Resource Server has the opportunity to register resource sets, but its responsibility for performing this task begins now. The Resource Server Operator may have contracted with the Authorizing Party for service-level agreements to respond specifically to timeliness needs and so on. This obligation can be removed through PAT revocation.
