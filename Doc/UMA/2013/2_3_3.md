Title=Resource Server Operator-Authorization Server Operator: Respect-Permissions

Text=When the Resource Server successfully introspects a "bearer" RPT, the Resource Server Operator gains an obligation to the Authorization Server Operator to respect the permissions that the Authorization Server has associated with the RPT when the Resource Server subsequently allows or disallows access by the Client that presented that RPT.

Comments=The Resource Server Operator, as a Subject that is otherwise potentially not obligated to the Authorization Server Operator, carries a great deal of responsibility here not to allow access where the Authorization Server has not granted permission and to make every effort to grant access where the Authorization Server has granted permission. Its interpretation of scopes and permissions is not directly auditable by the Authorization Server. Further, issues can arise from the skew between permission validity periods and actual access. Defining and using different RPT profiles can mitigate the risk of failure or malice on the Resource Server Operator's part.
