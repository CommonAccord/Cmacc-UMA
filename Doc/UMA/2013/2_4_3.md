Title=Authorization Server Operator-Requesting Party: Request-Limited-Claims

Text=When the Authorization Server issues an AAT to a Client and as long as the AAT is valid, the Authorization Server Operator gains an obligation to the Requesting Party to request only claims that support the purpose of satisfying an Authorizing Party's policy.

Comments=At a later stage, the Authorization Server might ask the Requesting Party to provide claims for specific permission purposes at multiple Resource Servers and/or for multiple Authorizing Parties, but its responsibility begins now. This obligation can be removed through AAT revocation.

Issues=Non Signaled
