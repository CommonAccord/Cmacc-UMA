Title=Authorization Server Operator-Resource Server Operator: Follow-Policies-Accurately-and-Timely

Text=When the Resource Server registers a requested permission at the Authorization Server, the Authorization Server Operator gains an obligation to the Resource Server Operator to adhere to the Authorizing Partyâ€™s authorization policies accurately and timely in associating authorization data with RPTs presented with the registered permission's ticket.

Comments=At a later stage, when a Client approaches the Authorization Server presenting an RPT and a permission ticket, the Authorization Server matches Authorizing Party policies to the requested permission to drive any requests for claims and ultimate authorization processes, but its responsibility for performing this task begins now.
