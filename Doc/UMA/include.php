This is a modular form of the 2013 UMA draft.  Just playing around, not official, approved, reviewed or otherwise validated.  Each clause is separately stated and can be versioned in git and on GitHub.  <br>Currently, the text is labeled as "Text.*".  This is logical but also a bit heavy.  It means that as we chain together the clauses, we have Clause "Text.2.Text.3.sec" etc., whereas, if we didn't prefix with "Text.*" we could have "2.3.sec".
